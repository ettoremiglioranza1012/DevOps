This repository contains a data science project focused on exploring the relationship between penguin bill length and mass using the Palmer Penguins dataset. 
The project involves building a website with Quarto, featuring an app for penguin mass predictions based on machine learning models. 
The backend is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance with RStudio Server, JupyterHub, a machine learning API, and a Shiny app for interactive exploration.
